# MARKOV

Generates a markov chain useful for emulating styles of speech based on training data.

Training data consists of speakers. A speaker's name must appeaer on its own line beginning with the '>' character. All text following this line will be interpreted as being said by this speaker, until the next speaker line. Empty lines and whitespace at the beginning and end of a line are ignored.

`markov.cpp` produces a `markov_chains.json` file which may be fed to `generator.cpp` as the one and only command line parameter.

Tokenization follows these rules:
- Names must only consist of letters and spaces. All text after a non-letter, non-space character on a name line is ignored.
- The following six characters are considered distinct words: `, ; : . ? !`. These are called "punctuation words".
- All other words are sequences of (only) letters, underscores, dashes, and apostrophes.
- All other characters are considered delimiters between words. That is, they are equivalent to a space.
- Capitalization of the training data is ignored.

Tokens are generated by parsing all words in the text as per above. Each word is hashed and each new hash is assigned a token value from 0 to num_unique_tokens - 1.

Upon generation, the punctuation words are distinct from other words in that they are not preceeded by a space when printed. The latter three enforce capitalization of the word following them. Also, punctuation words are forbidden from occuring consecutively.
